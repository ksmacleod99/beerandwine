# Beer and Wine Notetaking App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). I am also using [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) for styling because I want to. 

### Things I've learned: 
- how to use conditional rendering 
- getting a better sense of what is a functional component and what is a stateful component. 
- good practice with git workflow! 

### to-dos
 - add ciders
 - add "where did I try this" 
 
### Scripts
`yarn start` 
runs on localhost:3000
